This package can be installed in R usingÂ 'devtools::install_github("SenguptaLab/HEXplasticity").' Depedency functions are located in the analysis R packages https://github.com/SenguptaLab/MF.matR.git and Albrecht lab Arena worm tracker Matlab package:https://github.com/albrechtLab/ArenaWormTracker 

Codes in the \generating plots folder are executable on raw data shared in the \raw data folder

For generating calcium imaging tracers and amplitudes use: 
(1)plotAWC_img.R to get AWC specific plotting parameters 
(2)plotASH_img.R to get ASH specific plotting parameters
(3)amplitude.R to get amplitude 
(4)plotF0_rawtraces.R to get raw GCaMP traces without correction 
(*check annotations of all of these)

For generating microfluidics behavior plots and chemotaxis index use:
(1)plotMF_residency_ctx on individual folders to obtain heatmap, residency, and chemotaxis index of each experiment
(2)plotMF_avg_residency on a group of folders to obtain average residency plots for each condition/genotype

Codes in the \data acquisition folder are not executable since the raw videos are not available in this repository due to storage limitations on GitHub.

Calcium imaging video processing: register_quantGCaMP.ijm

Microfluidics video acquisition: PX_MOJO.m

Microfluidics video processing: (#2-#6 scripts and dependency functions can be found in Albrecht lab Arena worm tracker Matlab package:https://github.com/albrechtLab/ArenaWormTracker)
